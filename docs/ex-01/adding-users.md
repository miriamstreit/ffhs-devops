**Invite Members**: In the "Invite members" section, enter the username or email of the user you want to add.
> If the user is not already registered on GitLab, you can invite them by email.

**Select Role**: Choose the appropriate role for the user (e.g., Guest, Reporter, Developer, Maintainer, Owner).

**Set Expiry Date (Optional)**: If you want the user's access to be temporary, set an expiry date.
